Our Generation

Our generation will be known for nothing
Never will anybody say
We were the peak of mankind
That is wrong, the truth is
Our generation was a failure
Thinking that
We actually succeeded
Is a waste. And we know
Living only for money and power
Is the way to go
Being loving, respectful and kind
Is a dumb thing to do
Forgetting about that time
Will not be easy, but we will try
Changing our world for the better
Is something we never did
Giving up
Was how we handled our problems
Working hard
Was a joke
We knew that
People thought we couldn't come back
That might be true
Unless we turn things around
